# marketcloud-swift-playground
Swift Playground using Swift 3 and Marketcloud Swift SDK

## REMEMBER to  add the '.playground' extension to the file you just pulled! Otherwise Xcode won't recognize it as a playground file and will result into a incorrect project format!

This playground covers almost the whole SDK. There are some builded tests and an example of working flow. Feel free to ask me any questions if you have some problems or to add your own tests!
